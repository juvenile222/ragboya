<html>The idea of an Impossible List originated with Joel Runyon. Unlike a bucket list, which catalogs activities to do at an indeterminate time in the future, an Impossible List challenges you to think beyond what is routine or commonplace and start making plans. Essential to me is that the points represent all areas of my life, including Professional, Fitness, and Travel goals. Itâ€™s easy to push lofty goals to the next day or next week or next year, so I am sharing my Impossible List here as a constant reminder to achieve my objectives and to hold myself accountable. Bolded items are in progress.</html>
